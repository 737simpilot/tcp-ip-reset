# tcp-ip-rest
Resetting Winsock in Windows 7.
These commands I have tried in Windows 7 and seem to work. They may work for Vista, Windows 8 and Windows 10, I don't know. I don't think the NetBIOS command will work in Windows 10, but the rest should.

This is my first Github project for the heck of it and this is all new to me. I'm sure there are other websites or Github repositories that share this already. I don't know.

By using any of these commands you are hereby warned that you do so at your own risk.

Now marked read only.
